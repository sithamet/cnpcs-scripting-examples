## Requirements for scripting

#### 1. Install Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is one of many editors to use in scripting/programming. We use it for its ability to make scripting really easy.

Make sure to download VSCode from its [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

#### 2. Choose a scripting language
CustomNPCs allows you to choose your own language to script in.
You only have to download a specific .jar file for your chosen language.
[Click here for info about enabling scripting](www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/customnpcs/scripting)

This repo contains only javascript examples for now so we assume you downloaded `nashorn.jar`.

If you are running CustomNPCs on a server, then only the server needs `nashorn.jar`.

If you are making a modpack for singleplayer or self-host use you'll need to include `nashorn.jar` in your modpack.
This can be problematic if you have a CurseForge modpack, but is easily solved because [someone uploaded `nashorn.jar` to CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-nashorn)

#### 3. Download this repo
Download this repository and open it up in VSCode to get started!
Create some directories. Organize the example files how you want it.

Do NOT remove `jsconfig.json` and `.vscode` or you'll lose your autocompletion feature.

## Getting started

#### Your first script
Decide what type of script you want to make. You can choose from:
 - NPC Script (Scripts that are executed by NPCs)
 - Item Script (Scripts that are executed by scripted items)
 - Block Script (Scripts that are executed by scripted blocks)
 - Player Script (Scripts that are executed by every player)


TODO: add explanation on in-game steps to run scripts

#### Example scripts
This repo contains some example scripts provided by people from the discord server. Some comments might be added/changed inside example scripts, but are kept as original as possible.

This list is sorted by simplest above.

 - `tempdata.js` by `Daot`
 - `storeddata.js` by `Daot`
 - `retreat_weapon.js` by `Runon`
 - `lockable_door.js` by `AnnikenYT`
 - `transporters_fee.js` by `Xelerax`

## The good stuff
This repo contains some extra handy files to enhance your scripting experience.
#### Snippets

TODO: Add explanation on snippets, what to type, etc

#### Intellisense (autocomplete)

TODO: Add explanation on autocomplete, how it works, etc

---
## FAQ

#### Intellisense/autocomplete is not working anymore 
Make sure your `jsconfig.json` and `.vscode` still exists within the root of your opened VSCode project.

#### What is all the @param stuff?
This is required for VSCode to know what we are programming. It tells VSCode stuff about the code.
